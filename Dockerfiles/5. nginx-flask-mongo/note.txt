In server.py the mongo container name is hardcode ie the container name has to be mongo only
because of this code 
>> client = MongoClient("mongo:27017")

so what I did is edit the compose.yml and set the container_name: mongo

because all 3 images are working fine individually and still its not running the app...

but mongo and flask not able to connect together due to difference container_name.
